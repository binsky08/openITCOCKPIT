# TelegramModule plugin for openITCOCKPIT 4

## Installation
```
apt-get install openitcockpit-module-telegram
```

## Configuration

- Open [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) in telegram
- Run `/newbot`
    - define e.g. openITCOCKPIT as name
    - define e.g. oitcTGBot as username

Your new bot is now located at [t.me/oitcTGBot](https://t.me/oitcTGBot)

- Copy the HTTP API token which was generated by the BotFather

**Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot**

- Open the openITCOCKPIT Telegram configuration, enter the copied bot token and save the configuration

- Add the 'host-notify-by-telegram' and 'service-notify-by-telegram' commands to your notification contact


## Usage

Notifications sent by the openITCOCKPIT telegram module can be received by any chat with a real telegram user or by channels.

With enabled two-way integration issues can be acknowledged by simply clicking button an action provided by the bot message.

The currently built-in two-way integration calls up interactions cached by Telegram and processes them every minute.

Therefore, interactions with the bot can take up to a minute to process!


## ToDo

- A real two-way integration for real-time interactions with a custom websocket for the telegram bot in openITCOCKPIT
